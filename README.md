## Note

The new React docs recommend defining components as function instead of classes [here is the link](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component)  
 I'm using class here to define components just for personal practice.

## Used languages and tools

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- React + vite for creation
- React-dom
- axios
- Class-based Components
